vfioctl
=======

vfioctl is a small helper utility to allow unprivileged users to bind
a set of allowed devices under the vfio driver.

The vfioctl binary is installed with the suid bit set under /usr/bin/vfioctl.
It is symlinked to both /usr/bin/vfio-bind and /usr/bin/vfio-unbind.

- The bind operation unbinds the device from the current driver and rebinds it under vfio-pci.
- The unbind opetation unbinds the device from the vfio-pci driver and initiates a device probe.

The /etc/vfio/vfioctl.lst file contains the list of allowed devices,
each specified on a different line:

== sample vfioctl.lst ==
0000:01:00.0
0000:01:00.1
